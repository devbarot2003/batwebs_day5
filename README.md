K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
<br>
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
<br>
However, it does not work efficiently for larger datasets, it is only efficient for smaller dataset and can be easily implemented for multi-class classification problem.
